## 💡 Key Design Decisions

### Caching Strategy
- **Intelligent TTL**: Variable cache duration based on query quality, length, and search method
- **Quality-Based Caching**: High similarity results cached longer (up to 24hrs)
- **Search Method Optimization**: Hybrid search results cached 1.5x longer than vector-only
- **Graceful Degradation**: System operates normally even with Redis unavailable

### Query Enhancement Architecture
- **Minimal Overhead**: Only processes short, ambiguous queries (<15 chars, ≤3 words)
- **Confidence Thresholds**: Enhancement only applied when confidence >0.5
- **Context-Aware Prompts**: Technical blog-specific enhancement prompts
- **Fallback Strategy**: Always returns original query if enhancement fails

### Performance Monitoring Design
- **Real-Time Metrics**: Live performance data collection without blocking operations
- **Configurable Alerting**: Flexible alert rules with multiple severity levels
- **Historical Analysis**: Trend detection comparing time periods
- **Non-Intrusive**: Monitoring adds <1ms overhead to API responses

### Testing Philosophy
- **Co-Located Tests**: Tests placed next to source code for better maintainability
- **Graceful Dependencies**: Tests skip gracefully when external services unavailable
- **Performance Validation**: Actual timing measurements in cache performance tests
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: All optimization features thoroughly tested

### Database Optimization Approach
- **Automated Analysis**: Periodic performance analysis without manual intervention
- **Recommendation Engine**: Actionable optimization suggestions
- **Health Monitoring**: Continuous connection pool and query performance tracking
- **Non-Disruptive**: Analysis runs without impacting production queries
